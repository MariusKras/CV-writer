Experience 1 — Personal Project
Defense Hackathon by Lietuvos Šaulių Sąjunga
Summary:
Entered individually with the goal of joining a team, integrating quickly, and contributing through ML and AI work. The goal was to apply computer vision to help drones locate themselves on a map without GPS. Despite no prior experience in defense or hackathons, adapted rapidly to a new environment and worked effectively with new people. The project won the hackathon’s top prize.
Key points:
- Spent the development period experimenting with neural network approaches, testing results, discussing new directions, and iterating fast. 
- The process was intense and hands-on, emphasizing experimentation and flow. Delivered a working (though not fully accurate) prototype by presentation day. 
- Adaptability, initiative, rapid prototyping, teamwork under pressure, applied ML experimentation, cross-domain collaboration, and effective communication with new teams.
Technologies: 
Computer vision, neural networks.

# Experience 2 - Personal Project
Museum AI project
Summary:
Built a prototype conversational AI chatbot for museums where visitors can select exhibits and ask questions. Implemented flexible interaction methods (gallery selection, potential QR code triggers). Contacted ~20 Lithuanian museums to test interest and feasibility, receiving limited replies but valuable feedback (cost estimation, digitization constraints).
Key points:
- During testing, encountered a real-world incident of unexpected Google Cloud spending when a user left the app open for days. Detected it via alerts, verified it was not a bug, and resolved it by adjusting limits and monitoring.
- Demonstrated initiative in outreach, ability to translate technical ideas into practical terms, and persistence in real-world testing.
Technologies:
Prompt engineering, RAG, and function calling; deployed on Google Cloud. Python, FastAPI, OpenAI API, LangChain, SQL, Git, Docker, Google Cloud. 

# Experience 3 - Current Work
Turing College - Learner Support Specialist (JTL) (07/2024–present)
Summary: 
Assisted learners in their studies.
Key points:
- Helped learners solve technical problems by answering questions, brainstorming solutions, and guiding next steps.
- Reviewed 200+ projects and gave specific suggestions to improve future work and meet requirements.
- Suggested changes to learning materials based on common mistakes and learner feedback.
- Led stand-up meetings to address blockers and keep progress on track.
- Informally helped new JTLs understand what to do in reviews and open sessions.
- Refined explanations based on learner reactions during reviews and open sessions.
Soft Skills: problem-solving; clear technical communication; adaptability; process improvement; coordination; ownership.

## Projects During Studies:

Interview preparation app
Summary:
Built an interview practice AI app. Combining technical implementation with domain understanding of “what a good answer is.” 
Key points:
- Learned both technical and domain sides quickly by asking targeted questions, validating conflicting input, and iterating.
- Joined a hiring stand-up, asked targeted questions, synthesized a workable approach, gathered feedback in follow-ups, and used that to shape the app’s logic and prompts.

Podcast Market Analysis (SQL + Dashboard)
Summary:
Analyzed ~100,000 podcasts and 2 million reviews from Apple Podcasts using SQL. Cleaned data, joined tables, and aggregated metrics to identify the most promising categories for new podcasts. Found “Kids & Family” and “True Crime” to be the strongest niches. 
Key points:
- Created a Looker dashboard summarizing key findings (category popularity, review trends, ratings). Focused on clarity and selectivity — a few visuals that conveyed the main story effectively. 
- Received positive reviewer feedback for focus and clarity.
- Learned how SQL and dashboards together can turn messy data into clear, decision-ready insights.
